# Adblock Research

This project is dedicated to the investigative analysis of third-party websites and scripts. The primary goal is to identify and document candidates for ad-blocking based on their behavior, particularly focusing on user experience and privacy.

## Methodology

The analysis involves:
-   **Fact-Finding:** Documenting the purpose and origin of scripts.
-   **Code Analysis:** Deeply analyzing JavaScript to understand its functionality, data collection, and browser interactions.
-   **Behavioral Analysis:** Identifying user annoyances (pop-ups, resource usage) and privacy infringements (tracking, fingerprinting).

All findings are documented in Markdown files within this repository.
